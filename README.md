This repository presents an in-depth analysis and quantitative comparison between the **Median Filter** and the more advanced **Bilateral Filter**. The project evaluates their effectiveness in reducing two distinct types of noise‚Äî**Salt-and-Pepper** and **Gaussian**‚Äîin CCTV images.

The evaluation is performed not only visually but also through quantitative metrics: **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** and **Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)**.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Advanced Filter Comparison**: Directly compares a standard non-linear filter (Median) with a sophisticated edge-preserving filter (Bilateral).
- **Dual-Noise Analysis**: Tests filter performance against both impulse noise (Salt-and-Pepper) and additive noise (Gaussian).
- **Quantitative Evaluation**: Uses PSNR and SSIM metrics to provide an objective assessment of image quality and restoration accuracy.
- **Side-by-Side Visualization**: Presents clear visual comparisons for each noise type and filter combination.

## üìä Results Showcase

The notebook processes an original image by applying two different types of noise to it.

### Case 1: Salt-and-Pepper Noise
For salt-and-pepper noise, the **Median Filter** provides a significantly better result. This is confirmed by both visual inspection and the higher PSNR/SSIM scores displayed in the output.

### Case 2: Gaussian Noise
For Gaussian noise, the **Bilateral Filter** excels at preserving edges while smoothing, making it the superior choice for this scenario.
